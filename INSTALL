        OCamltop-gtk installation

*** What you need ***
- OCaml 3.12 (or later) installed
- findlib
     http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html
- Gtktop >= 2.0
     http://zoggy.github.com/gtktop/
- make ;-)

*** How to compile ***
- ./configure --with-ocaml-src-dir=/directory/of/compiled/ocaml/sources
- make all
- make install

This will install:
- the findlib package "ocamltop-gtk",
- the ocamltop-gtk executable (in the same directory as ocamlc)
- the mk-ocamltop-gtk script  (in the same directory as ocamlc)
  which is the same as ocamlmktop but produces a gtk interface.
